# Proposals
My ideas for my final project are...

1. Analyze behavioral experiment data and build a model to decompose features from word memorability
  + Process experiment data to calculate memorability score of ~400 Chinese word stimulus and tests their consistency.
  + Capture multiple feature data from online sources and label word stimulus with different features(word frequency, semantic centrality, sentiment, concreteness, liveliness etc.)
  + Use a regression model to predict word memorability based on these features and make statistical inferences about features
  + Construct a decision tree model to see whether it can effectivelly predict word memorability

2. Write an automated constructor of memorability-related online experiment programs with various customization options
  + Customize the experiment paradigm with various features like frequency and order control of test trials, stimulus display options and participant response modes.
  + Construct structred record files packaged in classes, with built-in individual-level and population-level analysis methods
  + Experiment record files can be uploaded to an online storage for experimenter to collect

My plan for final projects:
1. 
+ By week 4: Search for available tools on regression and decision tree model building, and sources of word attributes data.
+ By week 5: completed consistency analysis based on experiment data
+ By week 6: extract word attribute data and organize them for subsequent usage
+ By week 7: complete the logistic regression model
+ By week 8: complete the decision tree model
